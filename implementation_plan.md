# Implementation Plan

[Overview]
Implement the `bulkSettle` function in `dashboard-worker/workspaces/@fire22-api-consolidated/src/controllers/admin.controller.js` to process multiple wager settlements. This implementation will include placeholder logic for database interactions, similar to the `settleWager` function. The goal is to provide a functional skeleton for future development.

[Types]
No new types are immediately required for this placeholder implementation. The existing `request` object is assumed to contain `validatedBody` or the ability to parse JSON from the request.

[Files]
Modify the existing file:
- `dashboard-worker/workspaces/@fire22-api-consolidated/src/controllers/admin.controller.js`: Update the `bulkSettle` function.

[Functions]
Modified function:
- `bulkSettle(request)`: Located in `dashboard-worker/workspaces/@fire22-api-consolidated/src/controllers/admin.controller.js`.
  - **Required changes**: Replace the `// TODO: Implement bulk settlement logic` comment with placeholder logic that simulates database interaction for bulk wager settlement. This will involve iterating through the `wagers` array from the request body and logging each wager's settlement attempt.

[Classes]
No new classes will be created or modified beyond the existing `admin.controller.js` structure.

[Dependencies]
No new external dependencies are required for this placeholder implementation.

[Testing]
Add a placeholder test case for `bulkSettle`.
- **Test file**: `dashboard-worker/test/fire22-api-integration.test.ts` (or create a new test file if more appropriate, e.g., `dashboard-worker/test/admin.controller.test.ts`).
- **Validation strategies**: The test will verify that the `bulkSettle` function returns a successful response with the correct count of settled wagers. It will not involve actual database interaction but will confirm the API response structure.

[Implementation Order]
1. Modify the `bulkSettle` function in `dashboard-worker/workspaces/@fire22-api-consolidated/src/controllers/admin.controller.js` with the placeholder logic.
2. Add a placeholder test case for the `bulkSettle` function in `dashboard-worker/test/fire22-api-integration.test.ts` (or a new test file).
