## 🎯 **Specific Architectural Validations**

### **1. Domain-Driven Design ✅ PROVEN**

**Before:** All logic fused in massive files
**After:** Isolated domain controllers and services
**Impact:** Parallel development, isolated failures, easier testing

### **2. Separation of Concerns ✅ PROVEN**

**Before:** 3,000+ line "routing dump" controller
**After:** 6 focused domain controllers
**Impact:** API paths map 1:1 to filesystem, intuitive navigation

### **3. Event-Driven Architecture ✅ PROVEN**

**Before:** Transaction processing, balance updates, commissions coupled
**After:** Independent event-driven services
**Impact:** Loose coupling, system resilience, independent scaling

### **4. Facade Pattern ✅ PROVEN**

**Before:** "God client" with mixed concerns
**After:** Clean public API with hidden implementations
**Impact:** Implementation hiding, clean contracts, easier maintenance

### **5. Type Safety ✅ PROVEN**

**Before:** Duplicate, divergent types defined ad-hoc
**After:** Single source of truth in centralized types directory
**Impact:** Contract-driven development, reduced bugs, better IDE support
