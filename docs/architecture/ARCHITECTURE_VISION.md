# Architecture Vision & 90-Day Roadmap

_Confidential â€“ Executive Circulation_

## Executive Summary

The enterprise refactor transformed a fragile monolith into a **scalable revenue platform**.
We now move from risk-mitigation to **offensive growth** in four deliberate moves.

### 1. Deepen Domain Authority

- **Action**: Publish canonical `Balance`, `Transaction`, `Agent` schemas as versioned packages.
- **KPI**: Partner onboarding drops from 3 days to 3 hours.

### 2. Fortify Application Integrity

- **Action**: Contract-driven middleware + OpenAPI + CDC tests.
- **KPI**: 99.9 % API backward-compatibility; zero Sev-1 incidents.

### 3. Enable Autonomous Teams

- **Action**: Split to domain services with independent release pipelines.
- **KPI**: 35 % faster feature delivery per squad; no cross-team merge conflicts.

### 4. Accelerate Strategic Expansion

- **Action**: New vertical adapters (eSports, iGaming) and white-label front-ends.
- **KPI**: First new revenue line live in 30 days; 70 % code reuse across SKUs.

### Resource Ask

- 2 Senior Engineers
- 1 Technical Program Manager
- 12-week runway

**ROI projection**: $1.2 M incremental ARR in FY-Q1 via white-label licensing.
