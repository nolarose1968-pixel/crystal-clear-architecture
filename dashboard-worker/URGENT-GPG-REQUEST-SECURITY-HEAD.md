# 🚨 URGENT: GPG Key Setup Required - Fire22 Critical Issue

**To:** Security Head  
**From:** [Your Name]  
**Priority:** URGENT - P0  
**Date:** August 28, 2025  
**Re:** GPG Key Setup for Fire22 Dashboard Worker Team

---

## 🔴 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

I need you to **create GPG keys for me and the Fire22 Dashboard Worker team
RIGHT NOW**.

### 🚨 **Current Critical Situation:**

- Fire22 data extraction is completely blocked (GitHub Issue #2)
- Need to commit fixes with proper GPG signatures
- Current setup is non-compliant (using SSH keys instead of GPG)

### 📊 **Current Status:**

```bash
Git signing enabled: ✅ true
Current signing key: /Users/nolarose/.ssh/id_ed25519_signing.pub (SSH - NOT COMPLIANT)
GPG installed: ❌ command not found
```

## 🎯 **What I Need From You:**

### **1. GPG Key Generation (URGENT)**

- **User:** nolarose
- **Email:** [your-email@fire22.ag]
- **Purpose:** Fire22 Dashboard Worker repository commits
- **Repository:** brendadeeznuts1111/fire22-dashboard-worker

### **2. Team GPG Keys Setup**

Please create GPG keys for the entire Fire22 team:

- **Security Team** (for credential commits)
- **Infrastructure Team** (for database/system commits)
- **DevOps Team** (for configuration commits)
- **Data Team** (for schema/migration commits)

### **3. Installation & Configuration**

- GPG installation instructions for macOS
- Git integration commands
- Department security policy compliance

## 🔥 **Why This Is Urgent:**

### **Blocking Critical Fire22 Issue:**

- **E7001:** Fire22 API 401 Unauthorized - needs credential commits
- **E7002:** Bun.secrets storage failed - needs infrastructure commits
- **E7003:** Database not connected - needs schema commits
- **E7004:** KV namespaces missing - needs config commits

### **Business Impact:**

- 2,600+ customer records cannot be synced
- All Fire22 data operations stopped
- Revenue tracking, risk management, compliance reporting offline

## ⏰ **Timeline:**

**NEEDED WITHIN:** 30 minutes  
**REASON:** Critical fixes are ready but cannot be committed without proper GPG
signatures

## 📋 **Immediate Tasks for Security Head:**

1. **Generate GPG key for nolarose** (5 minutes)
2. **Provide installation commands** (macOS with brew)
3. **Send team setup instructions** (15 minutes)
4. **Validate compliance** with Fire22 security policies

## 🔧 **Expected Commands You'll Provide:**

```bash
# GPG Installation
brew install gnupg

# Key import (you'll provide)
gpg --import [your-provided-key]

# Git configuration (you'll provide key ID)
git config --global user.signingkey [GPG-KEY-ID]
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
```
