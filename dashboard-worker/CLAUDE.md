# Complete fresh install
bun run fresh:install          # Clean all + install with lockfile

# Full production environment setup
bun run production:setup       # Clean + production install + build
```

### Trusted Dependencies & Security

**Lifecycle Script Security** (`trustedDependencies`):
```json
{
  "trustedDependencies": [
    "@docusaurus/core",      // Documentation generation
    "@docusaurus/preset-classic",
    "sharp",                 // Image optimization
    "esbuild",              // Fast bundling  
    "@swc/core"             // TypeScript compilation
  ]
}
```

**Dependency Version Control** (`overrides`):
```json
{
  "overrides": {
    "typescript": "5.9.2",        // Consistent TS version
    "@types/node": "^20.0.0",     // Node.js 20 types
    "prettier": "3.6.2"           // Consistent formatting
  }
}
```

### Workspace-Specific Installation

**Selective Workspace Management**:
```bash
# Install all workspace dependencies
bun run workspaces:install     # --filter='workspaces/@fire22-*'

# Production-only workspace install  
bun run workspaces:install:prod # --production --filter='workspaces/@fire22-*'

# Install specific workspace (when registry is stable)
bun run workspaces:install:selective api-client  # @fire22-api-client only
```

## Bun.secrets & Security Integration

### Native Credential Storage 🔐

Fire22 Dashboard uses Bun's native secrets manager for secure credential storage across all supported platforms:

```bash
# Registry Authentication Management
bun run registry:auth:setup --token=<your-token>    # Setup with token
bun run registry:auth:demo                          # Demo setup for development
bun run registry:auth:status                        # Check authentication status
bun run registry:auth:test                          # Test registry connectivity
bun run registry:auth:fix                           # Fix configuration issues
bun run registry:auth:delete [registry]             # Delete stored credentials
```

#### Platform Support:
- **macOS**: Keychain Services (secure, encrypted storage)
- **Linux**: libsecret (GNOME Keyring/KWallet integration)
- **Windows**: Credential Manager (Windows native credential store)

#### Implementation Details:
```typescript
import { secrets } from "bun";

class RegistryAuthManager {
  private serviceName = "fire22-dashboard-worker";
  
  // Store credentials securely using OS-native storage
  async storeToken(registryName: string, token: string): Promise<void> {
    await secrets.set({
      service: this.serviceName,
      name: `${registryName}-token`,
      value: token,
    });
  }
  
  // Retrieve credentials from secure storage
  async getToken(registryName: string): Promise<string | null> {
    return await secrets.get({
      service: this.serviceName,
      name: `${registryName}-token`,
    });
  }
}
```

### Security Scanner Integration 🛡️

Advanced vulnerability scanning during package installation using Bun's security scanner API:

```toml
# bunfig.toml - Security Scanner Configuration
[install.security]
scanner = "@fire22/security-scanner"   # Custom security scanner package

# Scoped package registries with authentication
[install.scopes]
"@fire22" = "https://fire22.workers.dev/registry/"
"@ff" = "https://fire22.workers.dev/registry/"
"@brendadeeznuts" = "https://fire22.workers.dev/registry/"
```

#### Advanced Audit Commands:
```bash
# Production-ready audit commands with filtering
bun audit --audit-level=high                        # High/critical vulnerabilities only
bun audit --prod                                     # Production dependencies only
bun audit --ignore CVE-2023-12345                   # Ignore specific vulnerabilities
bun audit --audit-level=high --prod --ignore CVE-X  # Combined filtering

# Comprehensive security validation
bun audit --audit-level=critical --prod             # Critical production issues only
```

#### Registry Configuration & Management:
```bash
# Primary Registry: Official NPM (public packages)
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# Private Registry: Fire22 Workers (scoped packages with authentication)
@fire22:registry=https://fire22.workers.dev/registry/
//fire22.workers.dev/registry/:_authToken=${SECURE_TOKEN}
//fire22.workers.dev/registry/:always-auth=true
```

#### Registry Deployment & Testing:
```bash
# Deploy the Fire22 private registry worker
cd workspaces/@fire22-security-registry
wrangler deploy                                      # Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

# Test registry connectivity and authentication
bun run registry:auth:test                           # Test all configured registries
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://fire22.workers.dev/registry/health
```

### Security Best Practices:

1. **Credential Storage**: All authentication tokens stored using OS-native credential managers
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning during `bun install` with configurable severity levels  
3. **Registry Security**: Proper authentication for private package registries
4. **Audit Integration**: Regular security audits with production-focused filtering
5. **Token Management**: Secure token rotation and management workflows

### Environment-Specific Security:
```bash
# Development: Relaxed security for faster iteration
BUN_CONFIG_AUDIT_LEVEL=moderate bun install

# Production: Strict security with comprehensive scanning
BUN_CONFIG_AUDIT_LEVEL=high BUN_CONFIG_PROD_ONLY=true bun install --prod

# CI/CD: Maximum security validation
BUN_CONFIG_AUDIT_LEVEL=critical bun audit --prod --frozen-lockfile
