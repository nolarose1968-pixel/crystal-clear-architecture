## üìã Commit Quality Standards

### ‚úÖ Good Commit Examples

```bash
# Feature addition
feat(api): add real-time sports data integration

Implement WebSocket connection to Fire22 sports feed for live
odds and game updates. Includes error handling and reconnection
logic for network interruptions.

Closes #234

# Bug fix with context
fix(dashboard): resolve race condition in user sessions

Session cleanup was occurring before async operations completed,
causing intermittent authentication failures. Added proper
cleanup ordering and additional logging.

Fixes #456

# Performance improvement
perf(patterns): reduce pattern compilation time by 40%

Optimize pattern weaver initialization through:
- Lazy loading of pattern modules
- Caching of compiled pattern metadata
- Parallel compilation for independent patterns

Benchmark: startup time reduced from 500ms to 300ms

# Documentation update
docs(security): add Bun.secrets integration guide

Comprehensive guide for migrating from environment variables
to secure credential storage using Bun's native secrets API.
Includes platform-specific setup instructions.

# Breaking change
feat(auth)!: implement JWT refresh token rotation

BREAKING CHANGE: Auth tokens now expire after 15 minutes and
require refresh token rotation. Client applications must be
updated to handle token refresh flow.

Migration guide: docs/auth-migration-v3.md
Closes #789
```

### ‚ùå Poor Commit Examples

```bash
# Too vague
fix: stuff

# Not descriptive enough
feat: update

# Wrong tense
fixed: added new feature

# Too long subject
feat(api): add comprehensive real-time sports data integration with WebSocket connections, error handling, and advanced retry logic

# No context for breaking change
refactor: change API format

# Mixing multiple changes
feat: add auth and fix bugs and update docs
```

## üîß Commit Quality Tools

### Git Commit Template

Use our commit message template for consistent formatting:

```bash
# Set up the template
git config commit.template .gitmessage

# Now git commit opens the template
git commit
```

### Commitlint Validation

Automated commit message validation runs on every commit:

```bash
# Install commitlint (done automatically)
npm install -g @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional

# Manual validation
echo "feat(api): add new endpoint" | commitlint

# Integration with git hooks via lefthook
# Configured in lefthook.yml
```

### Interactive Commit Tool

For guided commit creation:

```bash
# Install commitizen globally
npm install -g commitizen

# Use interactive commit
git cz
# or
npm run commit
```

## üìä Commit Quality Metrics

### Frequency Guidelines

- **Small, frequent commits** over large, infrequent ones
- **Atomic commits**: each commit should represent a single logical change
- **Complete commits**: don't commit broken code

### Message Quality Indicators

- **Clarity**: Someone unfamiliar with the change should understand it
- **Context**: Explain why the change was needed
- **Impact**: Describe what the change affects
- **References**: Link to issues, PRs, or documentation

### Automated Quality Checks

Our pre-commit hooks verify:

- [ ] Commit message follows conventional format
- [ ] Subject line under 50 characters
- [ ] Body lines under 72 characters
- [ ] No trailing whitespace in message
- [ ] References to issues are properly formatted
- [ ] Breaking changes are clearly marked

## üö® Security Considerations

### Never Include in Commits

- API keys, tokens, or passwords
- Database connection strings
- Private keys or certificates
- Internal system details
- Personal information

### Security-Related Commits

Use the `security` type for:

- Vulnerability fixes
- Security feature additions
- Dependency security updates
- Access control changes

```bash
# Security fix example
security(auth): fix JWT token validation bypass

Prevent token validation bypass in edge cases where malformed
tokens could be accepted as valid. Added comprehensive token
format validation and proper error handling.

CVE-2024-XXXX
Fixes #security-001
```

## üîÑ Advanced Commit Practices

### Squashing Commits

Before merging, squash related commits:

```bash
# Interactive rebase to squash
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Squash with descriptive message
git commit --amend -m "feat(api): complete user authentication system

Implements JWT-based authentication with:
- Login/logout endpoints
- Token refresh mechanism
- Password reset flow
- Rate limiting protection

Includes comprehensive tests and documentation."
```

### Reverting Commits

When reverting, provide context:

```bash
# Good revert message
revert: "feat(api): add real-time updates"

This reverts commit abc123def456 due to performance issues
in production. Real-time updates caused 200% increase in
database load during peak hours.

Issue tracking: #999
Performance report: docs/perf-analysis-2024-12.md
```

### Co-authored Commits

For pair programming:

```bash
feat(patterns): implement advanced caching strategy

Developed new caching layer for pattern compilation results,
reducing repeated computation overhead by 85%.

Co-authored-by: Backend Team Lead <backend@fire22.com>
```

## üéØ Team Practices

### Commit Review Process

1. **Self-review**: Check your commit message before pushing
2. **Peer review**: Team members can flag poor commit messages
3. **Automated feedback**: Commitlint provides instant feedback
4. **Learning**: Use reviews as opportunities to improve

### Commit Message Standards in PRs

- **PR title** should follow commit message format
- **PR description** should elaborate on the commit body
- **Squash merge** should result in a well-formatted commit
- **Department attribution** should include relevant department heads
- **Co-author attribution** should include collaborators with company emails

### Branch Naming Conventions

Align branch names with commit types and departments:

```bash
# Feature branches
feat/user-authentication
feat/dept-marketing-campaigns
feat/workspace-orchestration

# Fix branches
fix/memory-leak-dashboard
fix/dns-caching-performance
fix/registry-auth-tokens

# Documentation branches
docs/security-integration-guide
docs/department-structure-update

# Refactoring branches
refactor/pattern-system-optimization
refactor/multi-workspace-build

# Department-specific branches
dept/communications-hub-update
dept/technology-dns-optimization
dept/security-scanner-enhancement
```
