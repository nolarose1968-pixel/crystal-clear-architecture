# 🚀 Dashboard Worker Monitoring & Validation Workflow

This guide establishes the operational procedures to maintain your 100% success rate and ensure production readiness.

## 📅 **Daily Operations Workflow**

### **🌅 Morning Health Check (Daily)**
```bash
# Quick health check - ~30 seconds
bun run monitor:health

# Expected output: All systems healthy with 100% health score
```

**What to look for:**
- ✅ All 5 critical endpoints responding
- ✅ Response times under 5 seconds
- ✅ No critical failures
- ✅ Health score: 100%

**If issues detected:**
1. Check worker logs: `wrangler tail --format=pretty`
2. Verify database: `wrangler d1 execute fire22-dashboard --remote --command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players;"`
3. Test critical endpoints manually
4. Investigate and resolve before end of day

### **🌆 Evening Performance Review (Daily)**
```bash
# Quick performance validation
bun run test:quick

# Expected output: All critical endpoints working
```

**Performance benchmarks:**
- **Response Time**: < 3 seconds average
- **Success Rate**: 100% for critical endpoints
- **Error Rate**: 0% for production endpoints

## 🚀 **Pre-Deployment Validation Workflow**

### **🔍 Pre-Deployment Checklist**
**ALWAYS run this before any deployment:**

```bash
# Comprehensive validation - ~2-3 minutes
bun run validate:deploy

# Expected output: DEPLOYMENT APPROVED with 100% validation rate
```

**What this validates:**
1. **Local Environment** - Development setup
2. **Dependencies** - All required packages installed
3. **Configuration** - wrangler.toml and source files
4. **Secrets** - All required secrets configured
5. **Database** - D1 connectivity and schema
6. **Code Quality** - TypeScript compilation
7. **Test Suite** - 100% pass rate required
8. **Performance** - Response time validation
9. **Security** - Authentication systems
10. **Integration** - Fire22 API connectivity

### **🚫 Deployment Blocking Conditions**
Deployment is **BLOCKED** if any of these fail:
- ❌ Local environment issues
- ❌ Missing dependencies
- ❌ Configuration problems
- ❌ Missing secrets
- ❌ Database connectivity issues
- ❌ Test suite < 100% success rate
- ❌ Security validation failures
- ❌ Integration test failures

## 📊 **Monitoring Dashboard Commands**

### **🏥 Health Monitoring**
```bash
# Daily health check
bun run monitor:health

# Quick health check
bun run health:check

# Real-time worker logs
wrangler tail --format=pretty

# Database status
wrangler d1 execute fire22-dashboard --remote --command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players;"
```

### **🧪 Testing & Validation**
```bash
# Quick validation (5 endpoints, ~30 seconds)
bun run test:quick

# Full test suite (23 tests, ~2-3 minutes)
bun run test:checklist

# Pre-deployment validation
bun run validate:deploy
```

### **🔧 Operational Commands**
```bash
# Deploy worker
wrangler deploy

# Check deployment status
wrangler deployments list

# View secrets
wrangler secret list

# Database operations
wrangler d1 execute fire22-dashboard --remote --command "YOUR_QUERY"
```

## 🚨 **Alert Thresholds & Response**

### **⚠️ Warning Level (Requires Attention)**
- Response time > 5 seconds
- Health score < 95%
- Non-critical test failures
- Performance degradation

**Response:**
1. Monitor closely
2. Investigate root cause
3. Plan optimization
4. No immediate action required

### **🚨 Critical Level (Immediate Action Required)**
- Health score < 80%
- Critical endpoint failures
- Database connectivity issues
- Authentication failures
- Test suite < 100% success

**Response:**
1. **IMMEDIATE** investigation
2. Check worker logs
3. Verify database status
4. Test endpoints manually
5. Rollback if necessary
6. Fix and redeploy

## 📈 **Performance Metrics & KPIs**

### **Daily Metrics to Track**
```bash
# Health Score
bun run monitor:health | grep "Health Score"

# Response Times
bun run monitor:health | grep "Performance Insights"

# Test Success Rate
bun run test:quick | grep "passed"

# Database Status
wrangler d1 execute fire22-dashboard --remote --command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM players;"
```

### **Weekly Performance Review**
```bash
# Full system validation
bun run test:checklist

# Performance analysis
bun run monitor:health

# Database health check
wrangler d1 execute fire22-dashboard --remote --command "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM wagers;"
```

## 🔄 **Continuous Improvement Process**

### **Weekly Review Checklist**
- [ ] Review performance trends
- [ ] Analyze response time patterns
- [ ] Check error logs and patterns
- [ ] Validate Fire22 API integration
- [ ] Review database performance
- [ ] Update monitoring thresholds if needed

### **Monthly Optimization**
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Load testing validation
- [ ] Security audit review
- [ ] Integration health assessment
- [ ] Monitoring system improvements

## 🚀 **Deployment Pipeline Integration**

### **CI/CD Integration**
```bash
# Pre-deployment validation (required)
bun run validate:deploy

# Deploy only if validation passes
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  wrangler deploy
  bun run test:quick  # Post-deployment verification
else
  echo "Deployment validation failed. Fix issues before deploying."
  exit 1
fi
```

### **Automated Monitoring**
```bash
# Cron job for daily health checks
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/dashboard-worker && bun run monitor:health

# Pre-deployment validation in CI/CD
bun run validate:deploy
```
