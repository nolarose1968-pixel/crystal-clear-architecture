# Test Policy System - Quick Reference

## ✅ Policy Successfully Implemented

The Fire22 Dashboard Worker now has a comprehensive test policy system that
**prevents tests from running unless code passes all quality checks**.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Normal Test Execution (With Policy Enforcement)

```bash
# These commands now include automatic pre-checks:
bun test                    # ✅ Runs pre-checks first, then tests
bun run test:unit          # ✅ Runs pre-checks first, then unit tests
bun run test:integration   # ✅ Runs pre-checks first, then integration tests
bun run test:coverage     # ✅ Runs pre-checks first, then coverage tests
```

### Emergency Bypass (Use Only When Necessary)

```bash
# If you absolutely must skip pre-checks:
bun run test:bypass test
bun run test:bypass test:unit
bun run test:bypass test:integration
```

## 🔍 What Gets Checked Before Tests Run

1. **Code Linting** - ESLint validation for code quality
2. **TypeScript Type Checking** - Ensures type safety
3. **Syntax Validation** - Bun build check for syntax errors
4. **Security Audit** - Checks for vulnerable dependencies
5. **Dependency Audit** - Additional security validation

## 📋 Policy Configuration

Edit `.testpolicy` to customize enforcement:

```bash
# Current settings:
POLICY_ENABLED=true              # Policy is active
STRICT_MODE=true                 # Strict enforcement
FAIL_FAST=true                  # Stop on first failure
REQUIRE_CODE_LINT=true          # ESLint required
REQUIRE_TYPE_CHECK=true         # TypeScript checking required
REQUIRE_SYNTAX_VALIDATION=true  # Syntax validation required
REQUIRE_SECURITY_SCAN=true      # Security scan required
REQUIRE_DEPENDENCY_AUDIT=true   # Dependency audit required
```

## ⚡ Example Policy Enforcement Flow

```
🚀 User runs: bun test
         ↓
📋 Test Policy Enforcer Activated
         ↓
🔍 Running Pre-Checks:
   ✅ Code Linting... PASSED
   ✅ TypeScript Checking... PASSED
   ✅ Syntax Validation... PASSED
   ✅ Security Scan... PASSED
   ✅ Dependency Audit... PASSED
         ↓
✅ All pre-checks passed. Test execution authorized.
         ↓
🧪 Tests Execute Normally
```

## ❌ Failure Scenario

```
🚀 User runs: bun test
         ↓
📋 Test Policy Enforcer Activated
         ↓
🔍 Running Pre-Checks:
   ✅ Code Linting... PASSED
   ❌ TypeScript Checking... FAILED
         ↓
🛑 Pre-check failed. Test execution blocked.
🚨 TypeScript errors must be fixed before tests can run.
         ↓
💡 Fix the issues and try again, or use emergency bypass if needed.
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Tests Won't Run?

1. Check what failed: `bun run typecheck` or `bun run lint`
2. Fix the issues: `bun run lint:fix`
3. Try again: `bun test`

### Need Emergency Test Run?

```bash
bun run test:bypass test  # Use sparingly!
```

### Disable Policy Temporarily?

Edit `.testpolicy` and set `POLICY_ENABLED=false`

## 📊 Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **No More Broken Test Runs** - Tests only execute on quality code
- ✅ **Faster Feedback** - Catch basic issues before expensive test execution
- ✅ **Resource Efficiency** - Don't waste CI/CD time on fundamentally broken
  code
- ✅ **Security Enforcement** - Prevent tests on vulnerable dependencies
- ✅ **Team Quality Standards** - Consistent code quality across all developers

## 📝 Commands Added

| Command                         | Description                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `bun run pretest`               | Run pre-checks manually     |
| `bun run test:bypass [command]` | Emergency bypass wrapper    |
| `bun run lint`                  | Code linting check          |
| `bun run typecheck`             | TypeScript type checking    |
| `bun run security:audit`        | Security vulnerability scan |

---

**🎯 Policy Goal Achieved**: Tests now **cannot run** without passing code
quality gates, ensuring efficient use of testing resources and maintaining high
code standards.
