### **Enhanced Withdrawal Processing with Bun Runtime**

```typescript
// Enhanced withdrawal processor with Bun runtime integration
```javascript
import { randomUUIDv7 } from "bun";
```

class EnhancedWithdrawalProcessor {
  async processWithdrawalRequest(request: WithdrawalRequest): Promise<WithdrawalResult> {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    
    try {
      // Generate unique withdrawal ID with Bun UUID
      const withdrawalId = randomUUIDv7();
      
      // Validate customer balance with enhanced performance
      const balanceCheck = await this.validateCustomerBalance(request.customerId, request.amount);
      
      if (!balanceCheck.valid) {
        return {
          success: false,
          error: 'Insufficient balance',
          details: balanceCheck.details
        };
      }
      
      // Process withdrawal with performance monitoring
      const result = await this.createWithdrawalRecord({
        id: withdrawalId,
        ...request,
        status: 'pending',
        createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
      });
      
      const duration = performance.now() - startTime;
      console.log(`Withdrawal request processed in ${duration.toFixed(2)}ms`);
      
      return {
        success: true,
        withdrawalId,
        status: 'pending',
        processingTime: duration
      };
      
    } catch (error) {
      const duration = performance.now() - startTime;
      console.error(`Withdrawal processing failed after ${duration.toFixed(2)}ms:`, error);
      
      return {
        success: false,
        error: error.message,
        processingTime: duration
      };
    }
  }
  
  async sleep(ms: number) {
    // Use Bun's optimized sleep function for rate limiting
    await Bun.sleep(ms);
  }
