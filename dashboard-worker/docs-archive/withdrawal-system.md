### **Enhanced Withdrawal Processing with Bun Runtime**

````typescript
// Enhanced withdrawal processor with Bun runtime integration
```javascript
import { randomUUIDv7 } from "bun";
````

class EnhancedWithdrawalProcessor { async processWithdrawalRequest(request:
WithdrawalRequest): Promise<WithdrawalResult> { const startTime =
performance.now();

    try {
      // Generate unique withdrawal ID with Bun UUID
      const withdrawalId = randomUUIDv7();

      // Validate customer balance with enhanced performance
      const balanceCheck = await this.validateCustomerBalance(request.customerId, request.amount);

      if (!balanceCheck.valid) {
        return {
          success: false,
          error: 'Insufficient balance',
          details: balanceCheck.details
        };
      }

      // Process withdrawal with performance monitoring
      const result = await this.createWithdrawalRecord({
        id: withdrawalId,
        ...request,
        status: 'pending',
        createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
      });

      const duration = performance.now() - startTime;
      console.log(`Withdrawal request processed in ${duration.toFixed(2)}ms`);

      return {
        success: true,
        withdrawalId,
        status: 'pending',
        processingTime: duration
      };

    } catch (error) {
      const duration = performance.now() - startTime;
      console.error(`Withdrawal processing failed after ${duration.toFixed(2)}ms:`, error);

      return {
        success: false,
        error: error.message,
        processingTime: duration
      };
    }

}

async sleep(ms: number) { // Use Bun's optimized sleep function for rate
limiting await Bun.sleep(ms); } }
