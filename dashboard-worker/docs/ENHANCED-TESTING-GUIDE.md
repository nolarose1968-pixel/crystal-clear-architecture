# 🚀 Enhanced Testing Workflow Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the advanced testing capabilities built on top of our
rock-solid `bun`/`bunx` foundation. Our enhanced testing system provides
intelligent test execution, performance monitoring, and comprehensive reporting.

## 🎯 Core Features

### ✅ **Smart Test Filtering & Git-Aware Testing**

- **Git-aware**: Only runs tests related to changed files
- **Category-based**: Filters by unit, integration, e2e, performance, security
- **Priority-based**: Runs most critical tests first
- **Estimated runtime**: Predicts test execution time

### 📊 **Performance Regression Monitoring**

- **Benchmark tracking**: Records test performance over time
- **Regression detection**: Alerts on 20%+ performance degradation
- **Performance scoring**: 0-120 scale with trend analysis
- **Memory monitoring**: Tracks memory usage during test execution

### 📈 **Enhanced Coverage Reporting**

- **Quality gates**: Enforced coverage thresholds
- **HTML reports**: Visual coverage dashboards
- **File-level analysis**: Individual file coverage tracking
- **Recommendations**: Actionable improvement suggestions

### 🔧 **CI/CD Optimization**

- **Multiple execution modes**: bun vs bunx
- **Parallel-ready**: Optimized for CI environments
- **Comprehensive vs quick**: Different test strategies
- **Report generation**: JSON, HTML, and console outputs

## 🛠 Available Commands

### Basic Testing (Enhanced)

```bash
# Standard test execution
bun test                                    # Basic test runner
bun run test:unit                          # Unit tests only
bun run test:integration                   # Integration tests only

# Parallel execution ready
CI=true bun run ci:test                   # Enable CI mode
```

## 📋 Test Categories & Targeting

### Automatic Category Detection

Our system automatically categorizes tests based on file location and naming:

- **Unit Tests**: `src/` files → `tests/unit/`
- **Integration**: API controllers, services → `tests/integration/`
- **E2E**: Browser tests, full workflows → `tests/e2e/`
- **Performance**: Benchmarks, load tests → `tests/performance/`
- **Security**: Auth, permissions → `tests/security/`

### Priority System

Tests are prioritized based on:

1. **Core files** (`src/api/`, `src/utils/`) - Priority +3
2. **Configuration** (`config`, `env`) - Priority +2
3. **Types & interfaces** - Priority +1
4. **Test files themselves** - Priority -1

## 📊 Reports & Analytics

### 📁 Report Locations

```
reports/
├── benchmarks/
│   ├── test-performance-history.json     # Historical performance data
│   └── benchmark-2025-08-28-abc123.json  # Detailed benchmark reports
└── coverage/
    ├── coverage-2025-08-28.json          # Coverage analysis
    └── coverage-summary.html             # Visual coverage report

### 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Duration tracking**: Millisecond precision timing
- **Memory monitoring**: Heap usage before/after
- **Regression detection**: 20% threshold for alerts
- **Trend analysis**: Improving, stable, or regressing
- **Performance scoring**: 0-120 scale

### 🎯 Coverage Thresholds

```typescript
// Global thresholds (entire codebase)
global: {
  statements: 80%,
  branches: 75%,
  functions: 80%,
  lines: 80%
}

// Individual file thresholds
individual: {
  statements: 70%,
  branches: 60%,
  functions: 70%,
  lines: 70%
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Runtime selection
USE_BUNX=true                             # Use bunx instead of bun

# CI mode
CI=true                                   # Enable CI optimizations

# Coverage
FORCE_COLOR=0                             # Disable colors for parsing
```

### Git Integration

The Git-aware runner automatically:

1. Detects changes vs base branch (`main` by default)
2. Maps source files to corresponding tests
3. Calculates test execution priority
4. Estimates runtime based on test categories
5. Provides efficiency metrics

### Performance Baselines

- **Regression threshold**: 20% slower triggers alert
- **Improvement threshold**: 10% faster noted as improvement
- **History retention**: Last 50 benchmark results
- **Score calculation**: Weighted by duration and success rate

## 🏃‍♂️ Development Workflows

### 💻 Local Development

```bash
# Quick feedback loop (recommended)
bun run test:changed                      # Only test your changes
bun run test:watch                        # Continuous testing

# Before committing
bun run test:coverage:enhanced            # Ensure coverage standards
bun run test:benchmark                    # Check for performance regressions
```

### 🔄 Pull Request Validation

```bash
# PR checks (fast)
bun run ci:test:quick                     # Changed files + benchmark

# Full PR validation
bun run ci:test                          # Coverage + performance + tests
```

### 🚀 Release Testing

```bash
# Comprehensive release validation
bun run ci:test:full                     # All tests + full benchmarks
bun run test:bunx:comprehensive          # Verify bunx compatibility
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### ✅ **For Development**

1. Use `test:changed` for rapid feedback
2. Run `test:benchmark` before major commits
3. Check coverage with `test:coverage:enhanced`
4. Use `test:watch` for TDD workflows

### 🔄 **For CI/CD**

1. Use `ci:test:quick` for PR validation
2. Use `ci:test:full` for release branches
3. Archive benchmark and coverage reports
4. Set up quality gate failures to block merges

### 📊 **For Performance**

1. Monitor benchmark trends weekly
2. Investigate regressions > 20%
3. Celebrate improvements > 10%
4. Keep test suites under 30 seconds

### 🎯 **For Coverage**

1. Maintain 80%+ global coverage
2. No individual files below 70%
3. Focus on branch coverage for critical paths
4. Use recommendations for improvement priorities

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Git-Aware Issues

```bash
# If no changes detected
git status                               # Check working directory
git diff --name-only main...HEAD        # Manual change detection

# Force full test run
bun run test:comprehensive               # Skip git-aware filtering
```

### Performance Issues

```bash
# Check benchmark history
cat reports/benchmarks/test-performance-history.json

# Run minimal benchmark
bun run scripts/test-benchmark.ts smoke

# Memory profiling
node --expose-gc $(which bun) test --coverage
```

### Coverage Problems

```bash
# Debug coverage collection
bun test --coverage --verbose

# Manual coverage check
bun run test:coverage:enhanced tests/unit

# View HTML report
open reports/coverage/coverage-summary.html
```
