# 🚀 Cloudflare Department Automation Proposal

## 🎯 **Executive Summary**

Transform Fire22 Dashboard deployment from manual GitHub Pages to automated
Cloudflare infrastructure with department-specific access controls, enabling
self-service capabilities for all 10 departments.

## 🏗️ **Recommended Architecture**

### **Phase 1: Cloudflare Pages Migration**

- **Current**: GitHub Pages (manual setup required)
- **Proposed**: Cloudflare Pages with automated deployment

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Infrastructure Components**

#### 1. **Cloudflare Pages**

```toml
# wrangler.toml configuration
name = "fire22-dashboard"
pages_build_output_dir = "dist/pages"
compatibility_date = "2024-01-01"

# Department-specific environments
[env.finance]
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "finance", DEPARTMENT = "Finance Department" }
route = "finance.dashboard.fire22.ag/*"

[env.support]
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "support", DEPARTMENT = "Customer Support" }
route = "support.dashboard.fire22.ag/*"
```

#### 2. **GitHub Actions Automation**

```yaml
name: 🚀 Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
    paths: ['src/**', 'docs/**']

jobs:
  deploy:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        environment:
          [
            production,
            finance,
            support,
            compliance,
            operations,
            technology,
            marketing,
            management,
            contributors,
            design,
            communications,
          ]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
      - run: bun install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: bun run build:department --dept=${{ matrix.environment }}
      - uses: cloudflare/pages-action@v1
```

#### 3. **Bun-Native Build System**

```typescript
// Department-specific build with Bun
async function buildDepartment(deptId: string) {
  const startTime = Bun.nanoseconds();

  // Build department pages
  await $`bun run scripts/build-${deptId}.ts`;

  const buildTime = (Bun.nanoseconds() - startTime) / 1_000_000;
  console.log(`✅ ${deptId} built in ${buildTime}ms`);
}
```

#### 4. **Cloudflare Access Control**

```json
{
  "name": "Fire22 Finance Access",
  "decision": "allow",
  "include": [
    {
      "email": {
        "email": [
          "john.smith@finance.fire22",
          "sarah.johnson@finance.fire22",
          "mike.chen@finance.fire22"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
