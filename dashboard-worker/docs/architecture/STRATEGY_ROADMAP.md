#### **Phase 2: Domain Validation Logic (Weeks 3-5)**

- [ ] **Collections Validation**:
  - Settlement amount limits and rules
  - Payment method validation
  - Customer eligibility checks
- [ ] **Distributions Validation**:
  - Commission calculation verification
  - Tax compliance validation
  - Payment method security checks
- [ ] **Free Play Validation**:
  - Bonus eligibility rules
  - Wagering requirement enforcement
  - Anti-fraud detection

#### **Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Weeks 6-8)**
