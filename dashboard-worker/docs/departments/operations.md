The Operations department integrates with the **Natural Hierarchy Aggregation System** while maintaining its primarily department-based structure.

#### Cross-System Connections

```bash
# Find all Operations leadership and team members
curl -X POST /api/hierarchy/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "department": "Operations"
  }'
```

#### Department Structure Analysis

**Jennifer Wilson** - Operations Leadership
- **Department System**: VP of Operations (71 implementations, 24 team members)
- **No Cross-References**: Primarily exists in department system
- **Leadership Role**: Clear operational leadership with significant team responsibility

**Team Composition**
- **Leadership**: 1 (Jennifer Wilson - VP level)
- **Managers**: 3 (Operations Manager, QA Lead, Facilities Manager)
- **Specialists**: 8 (Process improvement, automation, quality specialists)

#### Hierarchy API Examples

```javascript
// Get Operations department structure
const operations = await fetch('/api/hierarchy/query', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    department: 'Operations'
  })
}).then(r => r.json());

// Analyze team structure
const teamAnalysis = {
  leadership: operations.results.filter(p => p.context?.isLeadership),
  managers: operations.results.filter(p => p.context?.isManager),
  contributors: operations.results.filter(p => p.context?.isContributor),
  totalTeamSize: operations.results.length
};

// Check for cross-system connections (typically minimal for Operations)
const crossRefs = await fetch('/api/hierarchy/cross-references')
  .then(r => r.json());

const operationsConnections = crossRefs.crossReferences.filter(ref =>
  ref.connections.some(conn => 
    conn.title.toLowerCase().includes('operations')
  )
);
```
