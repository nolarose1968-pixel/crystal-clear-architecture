# Fire22 Registry Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security policies and procedures for the Fire22 Security Registry, ensuring the highest standards of package security and integrity.

## Security Scanning Requirements

### Pre-Publication Scanning

All packages **MUST** undergo comprehensive security scanning before publication:

1. **Vulnerability Detection**
   - Known CVE scanning against NIST database
   - Proprietary vulnerability database checks
   - Real-time threat intelligence integration

2. **Code Analysis**
   - Static code analysis for security patterns
   - Dynamic analysis for runtime vulnerabilities
   - Malware and backdoor detection

3. **Dependency Auditing**
   - Recursive dependency vulnerability scanning
   - License compliance verification
   - Supply chain risk assessment

### Security Score Requirements

- **Minimum Score**: 50/100 (configurable per environment)
- **Recommended Score**: 80/100+
- **Enterprise Score**: 90/100+

### Risk Level Classification

- **Low Risk (80-100)**: Automatic approval
- **Medium Risk (50-79)**: Manual review recommended
- **High Risk (20-49)**: Security team review required
- **Critical Risk (0-19)**: Publication blocked

## Package Validation Standards

### Metadata Requirements

1. **Required Fields**
   - Package name (must match allowed scopes)
   - Semantic version
   - Description
   - License (must be approved license)
   - Author information

2. **Security Metadata**
   - Security scan timestamp
   - Vulnerability count
   - Risk assessment
   - Remediation recommendations

### Content Restrictions

#### Prohibited Content
- Malicious code or backdoors
- Cryptocurrency miners
- Keyloggers or data harvesting tools
- Unauthorized network activity
- Code obfuscation (unless justified)

#### Restricted Content
- Binary executables (require manual review)
- Native modules (enhanced scanning)
- Network libraries (additional security checks)
- File system access (permission validation)

## Authentication and Authorization

### API Authentication

1. **Token-Based Authentication**
   - Bearer tokens for all API operations
   - JWT with RS256 signing
   - Token expiration and rotation

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - **Admin**: Full registry management
   - **Publisher**: Package publication rights
   - **Reader**: Read-only access
   - **Scanner**: Security scanning operations

### Package Ownership

1. **Scope Management**
   - Scoped packages (@fire22/*, @ff/*)
   - Owner verification required
   - Transfer approval process

2. **Version Control**
   - Immutable versions (no overwrites)
   - Version deprecation process
   - Emergency removal procedures

## Security Monitoring

### Continuous Scanning

1. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - New vulnerability database updates
   - Package integrity verification
   - Anomaly detection

2. **Periodic Re-scanning**
   - Weekly full registry scan
   - Monthly comprehensive audit
   - Quarterly security review

### Incident Response

1. **Vulnerability Discovery**
   - Immediate notification system
   - Automated package flagging
   - Risk assessment and prioritization

2. **Response Procedures**
   - Package isolation/quarantine
   - Stakeholder notification
   - Remediation coordination
   - Post-incident analysis

## Data Protection and Privacy

### Data Handling

1. **Package Data**
   - Encrypted storage (AES-256)
   - Integrity verification (SHA-512)
   - Secure transmission (TLS 1.3)

2. **User Data**
   - Minimal data collection
   - Anonymized analytics
   - GDPR compliance

### Storage Security

1. **Database Security**
   - Encrypted at rest
   - Access logging and monitoring
   - Regular security patches

2. **Object Storage**
   - Immutable storage for packages
   - Access control policies
   - Audit trail maintenance

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regulatory Compliance

1. **Standards Adherence**
   - NIST Cybersecurity Framework
   - OWASP guidelines
   - ISO 27001 principles

2. **Industry Standards**
   - npm registry compatibility
   - Semantic versioning compliance
   - License validation

### Audit Requirements

1. **Internal Audits**
   - Monthly security reviews
   - Quarterly compliance checks
   - Annual comprehensive audit

2. **External Audits**
   - Third-party security assessments
   - Penetration testing
   - Vulnerability assessments

## Emergency Procedures

### Security Incident Response

1. **Severity Levels**
   - **P0**: Critical security breach
   - **P1**: High-impact vulnerability
   - **P2**: Medium-risk issue
   - **P3**: Low-priority concern

2. **Response Timeline**
   - P0: Immediate response (< 1 hour)
   - P1: Within 4 hours
   - P2: Within 24 hours
   - P3: Within 72 hours

### Package Removal

1. **Emergency Removal**
   - Malicious package detection
   - Critical vulnerability discovery
   - Legal compliance requirements

2. **Removal Process**
   - Immediate package isolation
   - Dependency impact analysis
   - Stakeholder notification
   - Alternative recommendations

## Implementation Guidelines
