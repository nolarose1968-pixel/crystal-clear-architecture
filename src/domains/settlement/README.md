# Settlement Domain

## Overview

The Settlement Domain handles payment settlement and reconciliation operations in the Fire22 system. This domain is responsible for processing completed payments into merchant settlements, calculating fees, managing settlement lifecycles, and providing comprehensive settlement analytics.

## Architecture

### Domain-Driven Design Implementation

- **Entities**: Settlement (domain entity with business rules)
- **Value Objects**: SettlementFees (immutable fee calculations)
- **Services**: SettlementService (business logic orchestration)
- **Repository**: SettlementRepository (data persistence)
- **Controller**: SettlementsController (API entry point)

### Key Responsibilities

#### 1. Settlement Creation (`createAutomatedSettlement`)

- Create settlements for completed payments
- Calculate processing fees based on payment amount and currency
- Apply business rules and compliance checks
- Generate settlement references and batch assignments

#### 2. Batch Processing (`processSettlementBatch`)

- Process multiple settlements simultaneously
- Handle settlement lifecycle (pending → processing → completed/failed)
- Provide real-time processing status and error handling
- Generate comprehensive batch processing reports

#### 3. Settlement Completion (`completeSettlement`)

- Mark settlements as completed with bank references
- Update settlement metadata and processing notes
- Calculate final settlement amounts and fees
- Publish settlement completion events

#### 4. Analytics & Reporting (`getSettlementAnalytics`)

- Provide comprehensive settlement metrics
- Track success rates and processing times
- Calculate fee summaries and merchant performance
- Support date range and merchant-specific filtering

## Core Business Rules

### Settlement Limits

- **Minimum Settlement Amount**: $1.00
- **Maximum Settlement Amount**: $50,000 per settlement
- **Maximum Processing Days**: 30 days from creation
- **Weekend Processing**: Disabled by default

### Fee Structure

- **Processing Fee**: 2.9% of principal amount
- **Network Fee**: 0.1% of principal amount
- **Interchange Fee**: 1.5% of principal amount
- **Currency Adjustments**: EUR (-5%), GBP (+5%), CAD (+2%)

### Compliance Thresholds

- **High-Value Review**: $10,000+ settlements flagged for compliance
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Automatic compliance flag generation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete settlement history tracking

## Usage Examples

### Basic Settlement Creation

```typescript
import { SettlementsControllerFactory } from "./settlement-controller";

const controller = SettlementsControllerFactory.create();

// Create automated settlement for completed payment
const response = await controller.createSettlement({
  paymentId: "pay_123456",
  merchantId: "merc_789",
  amount: 99.99,
  currency: "USD",
  settlementType: "automated",
});

if (response.success) {
  console.log("Settlement created:", response.data);
  console.log("Settlement ID:", response.data.id);
  console.log("Net Amount:", response.data.breakdown.netAmount);
} else {
  console.error("Settlement creation failed:", response.error);
}
```

### Batch Settlement Processing

```typescript
// Process multiple settlements in batch
const batchResponse = await controller.processSettlementBatch({
  settlementIds: ["stl_001", "stl_002", "stl_003"],
});

if (batchResponse.success) {
  console.log("Batch processed successfully");
  console.log(`Processed: ${batchResponse.data.processed}`);
  console.log(`Successful: ${batchResponse.data.successful}`);
  console.log(`Failed: ${batchResponse.data.failed}`);
  console.log(`Total Amount: $${batchResponse.data.totalAmount}`);
}
```

### Settlement Completion

```typescript
// Complete settlement with bank reference
const completeResponse = await controller.completeSettlement({
  settlementId: "stl_123",
  bankReference: "BANK_REF_20241219_001",
  processingNotes: [
    "Processed via automated settlement system",
    "Compliance review completed",
  ],
});

if (completeResponse.success) {
  console.log("Settlement completed");
  console.log("Bank Reference:", completeResponse.data.metadata.bankReference);
  console.log("Final Status:", completeResponse.data.status);
}
```

### Settlement Analytics

```typescript
// Get comprehensive settlement analytics
const analyticsResponse = await controller.getSettlementAnalytics({
  merchantId: "merc_789",
  startDate: "2024-01-01",
  endDate: "2024-12-31",
});

if (analyticsResponse.success) {
  const analytics = analyticsResponse.data;
  console.log("Settlement Analytics:");
  console.log(`Total Settlements: ${analytics.totalSettlements}`);
  console.log(`Success Rate: ${analytics.successRate}%`);
  console.log(
    `Average Processing Time: ${analytics.averageProcessingTime} hours`,
  );
  console.log(`Total Fees: $${analytics.totalFees}`);
}
```

## Settlement Lifecycle

### 1. Creation Phase

```
Payment Completed → Settlement Created → Business Rules Applied
                       ↓
                Fees Calculated → Compliance Checked
```

### 2. Processing Phase

```
Settlement Pending → Processing Started → Bank Processing
                        ↓
                 Success/Failure → Status Updated
```

### 3. Completion Phase

```
Processing Complete → Bank Reference Added → Final Status Set
                         ↓
                   Analytics Updated → Events Published
```

### Status Flow

```
PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED
    ↓         ↓            ↓
 CANCELLED  FAILED       (Final)
```
