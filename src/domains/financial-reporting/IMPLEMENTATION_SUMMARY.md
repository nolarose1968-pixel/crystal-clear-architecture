  - Business rules for period validation
  - Display name generation for user interfaces

#### FinancialTransaction (Entity)
- **Location**: `src/domains/financial-reporting/entities/financial-transaction.ts`
- **Purpose**: Financial transactions with accounting classification and audit trail
- **Key Features**:
  - Transaction types: Revenue, Expense, Asset, Liability, Equity, Adjustment
  - Comprehensive audit trail for all changes
  - Business rules for voiding and adjusting transactions
  - Integration with AccountingPeriod

#### RegulatoryFiling (Value Object)
- **Location**: `src/domains/financial-reporting/value-objects/regulatory-filing.ts`
- **Purpose**: Regulatory compliance filings and submissions
- **Key Features**:
  - Support for IRS, FinCEN, SEC, and state filings
  - Filing priority levels and due date tracking
  - Auto-generation capabilities for certain filing types
  - Required document management

### 2. Service Layer Components

#### RegulatoryExportService
- **Location**: `src/domains/financial-reporting/services/regulatory-export-service.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handles regulatory reporting and export functionality
- **Key Features**:
  - Multiple export formats (CSV, XML, JSON, XBRL, PDF)
  - Regulatory body-specific formatters and validators
  - Bulk export capabilities
  - File integrity validation with checksums
  - Encryption support for sensitive data

#### AuditLogService
- **Location**: `src/domains/financial-reporting/services/audit-log-service.ts`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive audit logging for compliance
- **Key Features**:
  - Tamper-evident audit trail with SHA256 checksums
  - Multiple severity levels and event types
  - Automatic retention period calculation
  - Search and query capabilities
  - Compliance violation alerts

#### DataIntegrityService
- **Location**: `src/domains/financial-reporting/services/data-integrity-service.ts`
- **Purpose**: Data reconciliation and integrity validation
- **Key Features**:
  - Balance reconciliation (customer balances vs. ledger liabilities)
  - Ledger integrity checks (double-entry principle)
  - Data quality validation
  - Scheduled integrity checks
  - Automated alerting for discrepancies

#### Enhanced FinancialReportingService
- **Location**: `src/domains/financial-reporting/services/financial-reporting-service.ts`
- **Key New Features**:
  - `generateDailyTransactionReport()` - Queries ledger_entries for customer-facing accounts
  - `generateMonthlyPLReport()` - Aggregates data by revenue/expense accounts

### 3. Database Schema

#### SQLite Implementation
- **Location**: `src/domains/financial-reporting/schema/financial-reporting-schema.sql`
- **Key Tables**:
  - `financial_transactions` - Transaction data with accounting classification
  - `accounting_periods` - Fiscal period definitions
  - `financial_reports` - Generated reports with versioning
  - `regulatory_filings` - Compliance filing tracking
  - `audit_trail` - Tamper-evident audit log
  - `regulatory_exports` - Export history and metadata

#### Database Views for Reporting
- **`daily_transaction_report`** - Aggregates ledger_entries for daily reporting
- **`monthly_profit_loss`** - P&L calculations by accounting period
- **`balance_reconciliation`** - Data integrity validation view

## Addressing Your Specific Requirements

### 1. Daily Transaction Reports (DTR)

✅ **Implemented**: `generateDailyTransactionReport()` method
- Queries `ledger_entries` table for specified period
- Filters for customer-facing accounts (customer, revenue, expense)
- Applies configurable threshold filtering
- Formats data for CSV/XML export

### 2. Monthly Profit & Loss (P&L)

✅ **Implemented**: `generateMonthlyPLReport()` method
- Aggregates `ledger_entries` by account type
- Relies on consistent `account_id` usage for categorization
- Includes Gross Gaming Revenue, Bonuses/Promos, Net Gaming Revenue, Taxes, Net Profit

### 3. Uninterruptible Audit Trail

✅ **Implemented**: Comprehensive audit system
- `audit_trail` table with restricted write access
- SHA256 checksums for tamper-evident logging
- No UPDATE/DELETE permissions on audit records
- Automatic retention period calculation (3-7 years based on severity)

### 4. Data Reconciliation & Integrity

✅ **Implemented**: `DataIntegrityService.runReconciliation()`
- Validates customer balances equal ledger liabilities
- Checks double-entry principle (ledger entries sum to zero)
- Configurable tolerance levels
- Automated alerting for discrepancies
- Scheduled integrity checks

### 5. Amendment Workflow

✅ **Implemented**: Report versioning system
- `version` field in `financial_reports` table
- `parent_report_id` for amendment linking
- Amendment workflow preserves original reports
- Clear audit trail explaining changes

## Integration Points

### Event Consumption
The Financial Reporting Domain consumes events from:
- **Balance Domain**: Balance changes, threshold breaches
- **Collections Domain**: Payment processing events
- **Settlements Domain**: Settlement completion events

### Event Publishing
The domain publishes events for:
- Report generation, approval, publication
- Regulatory filing submissions
- Compliance violations and alerts
- Data integrity issues

## Security & Compliance Features

### Data Protection
- Encryption support for sensitive regulatory exports
- File integrity validation with checksums
- Restricted access to audit trail data

### Regulatory Compliance
- Support for major regulatory bodies (IRS, FinCEN, SEC, etc.)
- Automated filing requirement detection
- Compliance rule validation framework
- Audit trail retention based on regulatory requirements

## Usage Examples

### Daily Transaction Report
```typescript
const dtr = await reportingService.generateDailyTransactionReport(
  new Date('2024-01-15'),
  100 // threshold
);

// Returns formatted data ready for CSV/XML export
```

### Monthly P&L Report
```typescript
const period = AccountingPeriod.fromDates(startDate, endDate, 2024);
const plReport = await reportingService.generateMonthlyPLReport(period);

// Returns aggregated P&L data from ledger_entries
```

### Balance Reconciliation
```typescript
const reconciliation = await integrityService.runReconciliation(
  startDate,
  endDate,
  0.01 // tolerance
);

// Ensures customer balances = ledger liabilities
```

## Next Steps

1. **Database Migration**: Apply the SQLite schema to your database
2. **Repository Implementation**: Implement the repository interfaces
3. **Integration Testing**: Test event consumption from other domains
4. **Regulatory Formatter Implementation**: Complete formatters for specific regulatory bodies
5. **Scheduled Jobs**: Set up automated integrity checks and report generation

## Architecture Benefits

- **Scalable**: Designed to handle high-volume transaction reporting
- **Compliant**: Built-in regulatory compliance features from day one
- **Auditable**: Comprehensive audit trails for all financial operations
- **Flexible**: Extensible design for future reporting requirements
- **Robust**: Data integrity checks prevent financial discrepancies

The implementation provides a solid foundation for regulatory-compliant financial reporting while maintaining flexibility for business intelligence needs.
